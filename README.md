## Background

I found it is boring and time consuming while setting up development environment on different machines, e.g.
MacOS, CentOS, etc.

Inspired by the __DRY__ principle, I create this project as a scaffold to accelerate the process.

> DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.


## Install

__Warning:__ If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and
remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your
own risk!

### Using Git and bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Documents/code/dotfile`.) The bootstrapper
script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

    git clone https://github.com/dantin/dotfile.git && cd dotfile && source bootstrap.sh

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfile` repository and then:

    source bootstrap.sh
